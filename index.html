                <h2>Rodić Davidson: London Architecture</h2>
                <p class="page_text">
                Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London since 2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of
                London, we have developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often Listed and situated within a Conservation
                Area. Our knowledge and experience consistently secure Planning Consents, <a href="#">Listed Building Consents</a> and Great Estate
                Licenses.</p>
                <br>    
                <p class="page_text">Many areas within central London boroughs were originally developed by aristocratic families (examples being Grosvenor,
                Cadogan, De Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates still own large swathes of, what is now commonly
                referred to as, Prime Central London. These Great Estates maintain significant influence either through direct ownership
                or through various stewardship schemes, an example being the Belgrave Estate Management Scheme administered by
                Grosvenor. Schemes such as this enable the Estate to exert control over the use, development, and appearance of the
                designated area.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="page_text">We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London and elsewhere the UK. Through sensitive, contextual
                design and iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have established a track record of obtaining
                difficult planning consents for both new-build and existing properties.</p>

                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p class="page_text">We are Rodić Davidson, an award-winning architecture, design, and interiors studio with the belief that buildings are
                more than brick and mortar; they are an extension of ourselves and our environment. Our practice specializes in
                design-led and highly crafted renovations and new-builds. We pride ourselves on an ability to deliver thoughtful and
                imaginative design whilst safeguarding our clients’ commercial interests.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="page_text">We are and RIBA Chartered Practice based in Bloomsbury, central London. Whilst much of our work is local to us in
                London, the practice has an expanding portfolio of work across the UK; predominantly in the east and southeast of
                England but also including projects reaching as far as Scotland. We have experience working in rural locations,
                particularly in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent and Sussex where we have undertaken a number of farmstead and country house
                projects, for both UK and overseas-based clients. These projects often involve sensitive restoration of listed
                buildings, usually with some more contemporary new-build additions. The practice seeks to develop sensitive yet
                ambitious design solutions that celebrate heritage while recognizing that buildings are often now required to perform
                different functions and should consume less carbon in doing so. In striving for lower carbon design solutions, we look
                to insulate well and integrate renewable technologies wherever possible.</p>
